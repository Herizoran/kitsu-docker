# Kitsu Docker

Docker container for [Kitsu](https://kitsu.cg-wire.com/).

If you like the project, please add a star to the [Kitsu repository](https://github.com/cgwire/kitsu).

It is not recommended to use this image in production. It is intended for Kitsu
testing.

For this purpose, to simplify email testing, we include an email catch-all
application to intercept all emails sent by Kitsu. These can be viewed in an
included webmail.

### Usage

```bash
$ docker build -t cgwire/cgwire . # or sudo docker pull cgwire/cgwire
$ docker run --init -ti --rm -p 80:80 -p 1080:1080 --name cgwire cgwire/cgwire
```

In order to enable data persistence, use a named volume for the database and thumbnails:

```bash
$ docker run --init -ti --rm -p 80:80 -p 1080:1080 --name cgwire -v zou-storage:/var/lib/postgresql -v zou-storage:/opt/zou/previews cgwire/cgwire
```

To run the image as a daemon, add the `-d` flag:

```bash
$ docker run --init -d --rm -p 80:80 -p 1080:1080 --name cgwire cgwire/cgwire
```

Kitsu credentials:

* login: admin@example.com
